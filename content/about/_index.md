I am a current Ph.D. candidate in the [Quantitative Methods Program] (https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/programs/qme/) at the University of Minnesota- Twin Cities. My advisors are Professors [Nidhi Kohli] (https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/nkohli/) and [Seungwon Chung] (https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/swchung/). 

My main research currently focuses on model fit for intrinsically nonlinear mixed-effects models, which working primarily with repeated measures data (growth models). In addition, I am a research assistant on a project introducing multivariate nonlinear mixed-effects models with crossed random effects to an educational and psycological researach context. This project works with both cross-secitonal and longitudinal datasets.
